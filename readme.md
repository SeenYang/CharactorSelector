# Expectations:
* The code well written, structured, etc
* The code deployable and portable, probably as a docker service
* Unit tests
* Ability to extend it for changes as required
* The easy of use, speed and size
* The look and feel of the UI

# Task:
You are creating a factory that produces Characters, you could create one of the following characters
* Ninja 
* Panda 
* Pirate 
* Rockstar 
* Developer 

The customer(user) can choose any character and based on the type of character as listed above, 
we could customize them, so for example: 
For the Ninjas we can customize 
- the ninja-yoroi (their armour) 
- the weapons 
- the mask; 

for the Pandas, we can customize 
- the food;

for the Pirate, we can customizeï¼š
 - the eye patch
 - the uniform 
 - the parrot 
 - the wooden leg 
 - the hat;
 
 for the Rockstar, we can customize 
 - the uniform 
 - the instruments 
 - the song genre 
 
 and for the Developer, we can customize 
 - the language 
 - the speed 
 - the level. 
 
So when the customer(user) chooses a particular type of character, we need to present to the 
customer the list of things that can be customized,

Create a web service that can be used using curl (no ui) and a UI to this that can allow for 
creating new characters and customisations. 

Please do mention roughly how much time you took to complete the task. Once you are done, 
please send the code files, the deployment files, etc in zip format with instructions on how 
to run it and anything to watch out for or configure.
